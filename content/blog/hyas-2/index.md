**Introducing Hyas 2.0!**

Hyas 2.0 is a restructure release. Hyas is now set up modularly, separating e.g. configuration, content, and data from [integrations](https://gethyas.com/integrations/) and [themes](https://gethyas.com/themes/). The original focus on speed and security remained. Hyas ia a web framework for building fast, security-focused websites.

The five core design principles:

- **Hugo powered**: Fast website build times and flexible project organization.
- **npm managed**: Managing dependencies should be straightforward and easy.
- **Ready for production**: Your website is optimized for speed, SEO, and security.
- **Easy to use**: You donâ€™t need to be an expert to build something with Hyas.
- **Fully-featured, but flexible**: A growing number of Hyas integrations to choose from.
