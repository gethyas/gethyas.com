## VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular code editor for web developers, built by Microsoft. The VS Code engine also powers popular in-browser code editors like [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Hyas works with any code editor. However, VS Code is our recommended editor for Hyas projects. The [Hugo Language and Syntax Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=budparr.language-hugo-vscode) extension unlocks several key features and developer experience improvements for Hugo projects.
