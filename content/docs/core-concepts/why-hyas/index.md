Why choose Hyas over another web framework? Here are six core design principles to help explain why we built Hyas, the problems that it exists to solve, and why Hyas may be the best choice for your project or team.

## Hyas principles

1. [Dependency management]({{< ref "why-hyas#dependency-management" >}}): Manage dependencies in one place with npm.
2. [Site generator]({{< ref "why-hyas#site-generator" >}}): Hyas installs Hugo locally in your project.
3. [Code with confidence]({{< ref "why-hyas#code-with-confidence" >}}): Check for errors and fix automatically.
4. [Ready for production]({{< ref "why-hyas#ready-for-production" >}}): Top scores for security, performance, and SEO.
5. [Easy to use]({{< ref "why-hyas#easy-to-use" >}}): You don't need to be an expert to build something with Hyas.
6. [Fully-featured, but flexible]({{< ref "why-hyas#fully-featured-but-flexible" >}}): Make your Hyas website completely your own.

### Dependency management

### Site generator

### Code with confidence

### Ready for production

Good performance is always important, but it is especially critical for content-focused websites. It has been well-proven that poor performance loses you engagement, conversions, and money.

In many web frameworks, it is easy to build a website that looks great during development only to load painfully slow once deployed. JavaScript is often the culprit, since users phones and lower-powered devices rarely match the speed of a developerâ€™s laptop.

- [A+ scores on Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/hyas.netlify.app) out of the box.
- [100 scores on Google Lighthouse](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?gist=bc1047434376aa5b3e50cf637f8a5b40) by default.
- SEO. Use sensible defaults for structured data, open graph, and Twitter cards.

### Easy to use

__Hyas' goal is to be accessible to every web developer__. Hyas was designed to feel familiar and approachable regardless of skill level or past experience with web development.

One of our favorite sayings is: __opt-in to complexity__. We designed Hyas to remove as much "required complexity" as possible from the developer experience, especially as you onboard for the first time. You can build a "Hello World" example website in Hyas with just HTML and CSS. Then, when you need to build something more powerful, you can incrementally reach for new features and APIs as you go.

### Fully-featured, but flexible

__Hyas is an all-in-one web framework that comes with everything you need to build a website__. Hyas includes asset handling, a build process, bundling, optimizations, data-fetching, and more. You can build great websites without ever reaching outside of Hyas' core feature set.

If you need more control, you can extend Hyas with [plugins]({{< ref "plugins" >}}) like SEO, Images, and more, or use [themes]({{< ref "themes" >}}) like Bootstrap starter, Doks, and more. Connect your favorite CMS or deploy to your favorite host with just a single command.
